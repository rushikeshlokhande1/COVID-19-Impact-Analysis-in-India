# COVID-19-Impact-Analysis-in-India
🔍 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of COVID-19’s impact in India, focusing on public health trends, testing & positivity rates, and the economic impact on GDP and unemployment across states and sectors.
The analysis is visualized using interactive Power BI dashboards, with data cleaned, structured, and stored using Excel and MySQL.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

Excel – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation

MySQL – Structured storage and querying of cleaned datasets

Power BI – Interactive dashboards and data visualization

📂 Data Pipeline

🎯 Key Learnings

COVID-19 caused a significant spike in cases during mid-2020, followed by gradual recovery

Higher positivity rates correlated with lower testing capacity in certain months

GDP dropped sharply during the COVID period, with states like Haryana and Tamil Nadu showing major losses

Unemployment increased notably in Manufacturing, Construction, and Public Administration sectors
